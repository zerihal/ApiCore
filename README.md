## API Core

Provides a flexbile core web API (ASP.NET) that pulls in additional API projects that contain a service (recommended) or other class that implements the IApiModule interface. Currently contains sub-APIs for document analysis and code analysis.

Workflow templates allow deployment to Azure whereby the app can either be retained or automatically removed afterwards. Both workflows include endpoint testing.
